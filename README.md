Demo App for an internship application.

- Used Axios to handle API calls.
- Dark and Light theme selector.
- View Dummy user Data from https://reqres.in/
- Change pages.
- Responsive styling.

In addition I limited myself to only use Vue's color theme that was in base.css, it was a fun challange however I would have loved to use more accent colors.
